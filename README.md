# Inversion_Pebble
A Pebble Watchface

Inversion is a simple and intuitive Watchface that easily shows you the time using large bold numbers to show the hour. However, unlike other Watchfaces, it displays the minutes in a completely different manner. 

Watch as the blocks fill to the top, then fall again, ready to start a new hour. It's the simplicity of knowing the exact time of day without worrying whether it's 4:43 or 4:42.
